    <h1>Privacy Policy of ShopList App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
        The administrator of your personal data is Katarzyna Kędzierska-Nowak, with its registered office in Sulejów. You can contact the administrator at the following email address: <a href="mailto:pomoc@rndreamhome.pl">pomoc@rndreamhome.pl</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Nature of the Application</h2>
    <p>The ShopList App is a desktop application that, after its reconstruction, collects certain data on a dedicated OVHcloud server, while storing most user data locally on your device. The Application does not synchronize all data with external servers or transfer it to the cloud, unless explicitly initiated by the user (e.g., sending emails, which requires a connection to an email server configured by the user, or account data synchronization).</p>

    <h2>3. What data is collected and stored?</h2>
    <p>The Application collects and stores the following types of data:</p>
    
    <p class="section-title">On the OVHcloud server:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User's email address.</li>
        <li>User's password (stored as a key/hash, never in plain text).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="section-title">Exclusively locally on your computer in an SQLite database (the browserHistory.sqlite3 file and other application configuration files) and in the browser's localStorage (shopping list data):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User and Account Data:</strong> First name, last name, email address, gender. Passwords for the application and for email accounts (stored in hashed/encrypted form, never in plain text). Email account names. Phone number, avatar (if provided). Company data (company name, tax ID, address, contact details of the project creator), if entered in the account settings. Company logo (in Base64 format), if uploaded.</li>
        <li><strong>Shopping List Data:</strong> List names, creation dates, products (names, prices, quantities, website links, descriptions, images), cart status (whether the list is in the trash). Editor content for lists (editorContent). List-to-project associations.</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Data:</strong> Browsing history (URL, title, time of visit). Bookmarks (URL, title). Speed dial (URL, title, logo URL). Browser preferences (e.g., wallpaper path, default download path).</li>
        <li><strong>Mail Data:</strong> Email account configurations (account name, email address, IMAP/SMTP hosts, ports). Email content (downloaded and displayed from the IMAP server, not permanently stored locally in the application database after closing, but may be temporarily cached by browser components). Email attachments (temporarily saved to disk for preview or sending). Email signatures (stored in localStorage).</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar and Project Data:</strong> Projects (name, dates, color, completion status, creator and investor data). Calendar events (title, date, description, reminders). Hourly notes (content, date, time). Calendar preferences (e.g., default view, start of the week, working hours).</li>
        <li><strong>Invoice Data:</strong> Issued invoices are stored exclusively locally on the user's computer and are accessible only to the application user.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Settings:</strong> Language and theme preferences. File settings (e.g., PDF orientation, PDF quality, default save paths).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How do we use your data?</h2>
    <p>Your data is used solely to provide the functionality of the Application and improve your user experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To manage shopping lists, projects, and calendar events.</li>
        <li>To display browsing history and bookmarks in the browser.</li>
        <li>To send and receive emails via your configured accounts.</li>
        <li>To personalize the interface (e.g., language, theme, browser wallpaper).</li>
        <li>To generate PDF reports (e.g., from shopping lists).</li>
        <li>To handle authentication and manage your user account within the Application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The ShopList App DOES NOT share, sell, or rent your personal data or data collected in the Application to third parties. All data is stored locally on your computer and you have full control over it, with the exception of your email address and password (as a key), which are stored on the OVHcloud server for authentication purposes.</p>
    <p>The only exception is when the user consciously and actively initiates an action requiring an external connection, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sending emails: Sent emails and their attachments are transmitted to your configured SMTP server.</li>
        <li>Generating PDF files and saving them to specific locations.</li>
        <li>Opening external links in the system browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We make every effort to protect your data. Passwords are stored in hashed form (with salt) both locally and on the OVHcloud server, and never as plain text. Access to data in the SQLite database is restricted to the application itself.</p>
    <p>However, please remember that the security of your device and operating system is crucial for protecting local data. We recommend using strong passwords for your computer and applications, and regularly updating your operating system and antivirus software.</p>

    <h2>7. Control over data</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data stored in the Application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can view, edit, and delete your lists, projects, events, browsing history, and bookmarks at any time.</li>
        <li>You can manage your email accounts in the Application settings.</li>
        <li>You can permanently delete your user account from the Application, which will result in the deletion of all associated local data and account data from the OVHcloud server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be published in the Application and/or on the project website (if one is created). We recommend regularly checking this Policy to stay informed about how we protect your data.</p>
